# Arcade-Pong

An oldschool arcade Pong game made with JavaScript and Canvas.

- The right paddle (Player 2) is run by the computer, and the left one is the Player 1

- The ball accelerates if you hit with the paddle corners -- just like actual Pong

- When a player misses the ball, it starts again from the net in the middle.

- 5 misses and game over ‚ùå
